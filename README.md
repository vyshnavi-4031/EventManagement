Project Description
The Event Management System is a comprehensive application designed to streamline the process of planning and booking events. It allows users to select the occasion, choose venues, food, ambiance, and event details. After making selections, the system provides a preview of the chosen options along with costs. Users can then proceed to payment through an integrated payment gateway, ultimately displaying a confirmation message once the event is successfully booked.
